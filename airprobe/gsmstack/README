gsmstack - A GSM Um Layer 1 implementation
(C) 2008 by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>, portions from gsm-tvoid
========================================================================

This is a GSM Layer 1 implementation mainly aimed at the requirements of
a GSM protocol analyzer.  It starts off where the demodulation ends: With
the raw bits of the differential-decoded GSM Um burst.

Based on that input, the stack takes care of demultiplexing the bursts into the
various physical and logical channels, decoding the various burst types,
convolutional decode and parity checking (where applicable).

For the CCCH, it includes FCH and SCH processing. Frequency correction
informaiton can be signalled to the decoder/demodulator by callback functions.

The recovereed TDMA Frame Number will be passed along with all MAC blocks
to the Layer2 protocol instance on top.

The output of this Layer1 stack are the 23byte MAC blocks for control
channels, and the 260bits (32.5byte) speech frames for TCH/F channels

The codebase is currently unfinished and highly experimental.
