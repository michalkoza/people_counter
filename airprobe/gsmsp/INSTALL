A gnu radio implementation to receive and decode GSM packets.

Install
=======

./configure
make
# The release comes with a example capture file. Test if it works:
./run.sh

Analyzing GSM data
==================

The release does not support live captures (yet).

 1. Search for a base station in your area. See "BTS searching by Robert"
    or use the Nokia Field Tester (NetMonitor) to find the channel number
    of you operator and calculate the frequency from it.

 2. From the gnu-radio installation use usr_rx_cfile.py to capture data:
    Example of capturing 10seconds of gsm data on 940.8Mhz:

    # samples=`expr 64000000 / 118 '*' 10`
    # ./usrp_rx_cfile.py -d 118 -f 940.8M -N $samples 940.8Mhz_118.cfile

 3. Make the file available to gsmsp:
    # cd ~/gsmsp
    # ln -sf /wherever/the/cfile/is/940.8Mhz_118.cfile signal.data
    # ./run.sh 

Requirements
============

 * gnu radio (tested with 3.0.2 and 3.0.3)
 * python (tested with 2.4.4)
 * python-numeric (tested with 23.7)

Supported Platforms
===================

 * gentoo linux
 * cygwin

Limitations
===========

 * receiving only
 * only BTS -> MS traffic. 
 * no channel hopping
