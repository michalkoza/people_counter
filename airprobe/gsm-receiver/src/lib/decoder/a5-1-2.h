 *
 * Background: The Global System for Mobile communications is the most
 * widely deployed digital cellular telephony system in the world. GSM
 * makes use of four core cryptographic algorithms, none of which has
 * been published by the GSM MOU.  This failure to subject the
 * algorithms to public review is all the more puzzling given that over
 * 215 million GSM subscribers are expected to rely on the claimed
 * security of the system.
 *
 * The four core GSM cryptographic algorithms are:
 * A3              authentication algorithm
 * A5/1 "stronger" over-the-air voice-privacy algorithm
 * A5/2  "weaker"  over-the-air voice-privacy algorithm
 * A8              voice-privacy key generation algorithm
 *
 * In April of 1998, our group showed that COMP128, the algorithm used by the
 * overwhelming majority of GSM providers for both A3 and A8 functionality
 * is fatally flawed and allows for cloning of GSM mobile phones.
 *
 * Furthermore, we demonstrated that all A8 implementations we could locate,
 * including the few that did not use COMP128 for key generation, had been
 * deliberately weakened by reducing the keyspace from 64 bits to 54 bits.
 * The remaining 10 bits are simply set to zero!
 *
 * See http://www.scard.org/gsm for additional information.
 *
 * [May 1999]
 * One question so far unanswered is if A5/1, the "stronger" of the two
 * widely deployed voice-privacy algorithm is at least as strong as the
 * key. Meaning: "Does A5/1 have a work factor of at least 54 bits"?
 * Absent a publicly available A5/1 reference implementation, this question
 * could not be answered. We hope that our reference implementation below,
 * which has been verified against official A5/1 test vectors, will provide
 * the cryptographic community with the base on which to construct the
 * answer to this important question.
 *
 * Initial indications about the strength of A5/1 are not encouraging.
 * A variant of A5, while not A5/1 itself, has been estimated to have a
 * work factor of well below 54 bits. See http://jya.com/crack-a5.htm for
 * background information and references.
 *
 * With COMP128 broken and A5/1 published below, we will now turn our
 * attention to A5/2.
 *
 * [August 1999]
 * 19th Annual International Cryptology Conference - Crypto'99
 * Santa Barbara, California
 *
 * A5/2 has been added to the previously published A5/1 source. Our
 * implementation has been verified against official test vectors.
 *
 * This means that our group has now reverse engineered the entire set
 * of cryptographic algorithms used in the overwhelming majority of GSM
 * installations, including all the over-the-air "voice privacy" algorithms.
 *
 * The "voice privacy" algorithm A5/2 proved especially weak. Which perhaps
 * should come as no surprise, since even GSM MOU members have admitted that
 * A5/2 was designed with heavy input by intelligence agencies to ensure
 * breakability. Just how insecure is A5/2?  It can be broken in real time
 * with a work factor of a mere 16 bits. GSM might just as well use no "voice
 * privacy" algorithm at all.
 *
 * We announced the break of A5/2 at the Crypto'99 Rump Session.
 * Details will be published in a scientific paper following soon.
