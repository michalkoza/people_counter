This tarball contains a build tree with examples, Makefiles, etc that
demonstrate how to write signal processing blocks for the GNU Radio
system.  

To build the examples from the tarball use the normal recipe:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check

If you're building from CVS, you'll need to use this sequence, since
CVS doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check


The doc directory is not built by default.  This is to avoid spurious
build problems on systems that don't have xmlto installed.  If you
have xmlto and its dependencies installed, you can build the html
version of the howto article by cd'ing to doc and invoking make.
