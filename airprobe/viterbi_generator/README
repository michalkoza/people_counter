This is generator for Viterbi Algorithm part of Viterbi Equalizer.
It is able to generate viterbi detector for channels with memory lengths
of 2,3,4,5 symbols.

To generate function in C++ for channel memory length of four symbols (Lh=4)
just type:
$ make


To generate function for some other channel memory length type:
$ make Lh=x 
where 'x' is channel memory length (value from 2 to 5)

To check if algorithm works properly type:
$ make test Lh=x
